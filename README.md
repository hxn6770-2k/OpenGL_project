Computer Graphic and Visualization with OpenGL

## Design Approach

- **Approach to Designing Software:**
  - My approach to designing software involves a systematic and iterative process. I start by clearly defining the project goals and requirements. Then, I break down the tasks into manageable components and design the architecture with scalability and modularity in mind.

- **New Design Skills:**
  - Working on this project has honed my skills in creating visually cohesive and efficient 3D scenes. I've learned to strike a balance between aesthetics and performance, considering factors such as texture mapping, lighting, and the integration of multiple mesh objects.

- **Design Process:**
  - The design process involved careful consideration of project goals, breaking down tasks into smaller components, and adhering to a predefined set of rules for texture and lighting. Iterative testing and refinement were integral to achieving the desired visual results.

- **Tactics for Future Work:**
  - The systematic and iterative design approach can be applied in future work by ensuring a clear understanding of project requirements, breaking down tasks, and incorporating lessons learned from optimizing visuals and performance in 3D scenes.

## Development Approach

- **Approach to Developing Programs:**
  - My approach to developing programs involves a structured process that includes planning, coding, testing, and iteration. I prioritize creating clean and maintainable code while staying adaptable to evolving project requirements.

- **New Development Strategies:**
  - Developing the 3D scene involved implementing shader-based rules for light and texture interactions, creating foundational geometric shapes for objects, and integrating user interaction controls. The use of shaders and the incorporation of multiple mesh objects were key strategies.

- **Iteration in Development:**
  - Iteration played a crucial role in development, especially in refining the visual aspects of the scene. Regular testing and feedback loops allowed for adjustments in lighting, texture mapping, and user controls to improve the overall experience.

- **Evolution of Development Approach:**
  - The development approach evolved from an initial emphasis on foundational elements to a more refined focus on user interaction and visual aesthetics. Milestone-based iterations ensured that each component was thoroughly tested and optimized before moving forward.

## Computer Science and Career Pathway

- **Role of Computer Science in Goals:**
  - Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and the ability to design and implement complex systems. These skills are invaluable in reaching my goals by providing a solid foundation for various applications in software development, computational graphics, and beyond.

- **Knowledge and Skills from Computational Graphics:**
  - Computational graphics and visualizations have expanded my knowledge in shader programming, texture mapping, and the intricacies of 3D scene creation. These skills can be applied in future educational pathways, enhancing my understanding of computer graphics, simulation, and virtual reality.
